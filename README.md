This project was made with Simple Game Graphics Library.

This library (SGG) aims to provide a simple interface for students to include basic graphics, audio and interaction functionality in their applications written in C and C++.SGG offers an abstraction and simplification layer over SDL, OpenGL and other core windowing, graphics and audio libraries, providing a clear, simple and hasle - free programming interface to build from simple interactive applications to 2D computer games and data visualization tools.
